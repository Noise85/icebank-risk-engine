# Risk Engine Project

## Introduction
The Risk Engine project is designed to serve as a rule-based system for managing trading orders in a financial system. Its primary purpose is to evaluate and process trading orders based on predefined rules, ensuring compliance and mitigating risks.

## Understanding the Problem
In trading systems, a rule engine plays a critical role in enforcing business logic and risk management policies. It evaluates incoming orders against a set of rules to ensure they meet criteria such as size limits, price thresholds, and user-specific constraints. This helps prevent fraudulent activities, manage exposure, and maintain system integrity.

## Architectural Insights
### Classes and Components
- **`Order`**: An interface representing a trading order. It includes methods to retrieve the user ID, size, price, and a mechanism to accept a visitor for rule evaluation.
- **`OrderEvent`**: A class encapsulating an `Order` object, representing an event in the system.
- **`RiskEngineVisitor`**: A visitor interface or class that defines the logic for evaluating rules against an `Order`.
- **`RiskEngine`**: An interface and its implementations form the core of the system, responsible for managing and applying rules to trading orders.
- **`RiskRule`**: An interface defining a method to check an `Order` against specific risk criteria, returning a `RiskDecision`.

### Data Flow
0. **RiskEngine**: Implements `OrderEventHandler` so that it can respond to `OrderEvent`.
1. **Order Creation**: An `Order` is created with details such as user ID, size, and price.
2. **Event Generation**: The `Order` is wrapped in an `OrderEvent` to represent its occurrence in the system.
3. **Rule Evaluation**: The `Order` is passed to a `RiskEngineVisitor` for rule evaluation and processing.

## Rule Sets
### Building a Rule Set
To build a rule set:
1. Define rules as methods or classes implementing specific checks (e.g., size limits, price thresholds).
2. Implement a `RiskRule` to apply these rules to an `Order`.

### Example Scenarios
#### Order Size Limit Rule
A rule that rejects orders exceeding a size of 1000 units:
```java
public class SizeLimitRule implements RiskRule {
    @Override
    public RiskDecision check(Order order) {
        return order.getSize() > 1000 ? RiskDecision.reject("Size limit exceeded") : RiskDecision.allow();
    }
}
```
## Future Improvements
- **Integration with icebank trading platform**: Enhance the risk engine to work seamlessly with the Icebank trading platform, allowing it to evaluate orders in real-time as they are placed.
- **Rule Context**: Introduce a context object that can be passed to rules, allowing them to access additional information (e.g., market conditions, user profiles).
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Enhance the system with logging capabilities to track rule evaluations and decisions for auditing and debugging purposes.
- **Integration with External Systems**: Allow the risk engine to fetch real-time data from external sources (e.g., market feeds) to enhance rule evaluations.

## Conclusion
The Risk Engine project provides a robust framework for managing trading orders through rule-based evaluations. By implementing a visitor pattern and defining clear interfaces, it allows for flexible and extensible rule management. Future enhancements will further integrate it with trading platforms and improve its capabilities in real-time risk assessment.
